## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was good practice and brushing up on responsiveness, and planning and execution of HTML structure to fit all resolutions. I somewhat botched the mobile version in the process. It looks decent at about 500px and up; I should've started developing for an even lower resolution, as per the spec. Not gonna fix that this time around, but a lot was learned to use in the next project.
